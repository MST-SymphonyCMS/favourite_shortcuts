Favourite Shortcuts
=================

An extension that allows developers and authors to set Favourite Backend Menu items.

The extension is still in Beta, and at the moment items can be added in through `System > Favourites`.
Each item has a limit which is used to determine which level of users are allowed to view this item.
In a future iteration, a favourite icon is planned to be added in, which will allow users to save user-level favourite items, which other users cannot see.

Items which are of level "Author" or above are only visible to people which have at least that level of access.

All links are relative to the backend path, so only links to the admin can be saved and accessed in this manner.
